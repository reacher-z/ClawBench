# Contributing to ClawBench

**First-time open-source contributor?** We specifically want to hear from you. Most of ClawBench is plain JSON + a short schema, and the thing that makes the benchmark valuable is breadth of everyday tasks — which means the best people to contribute are the people doing everyday things on the web. If you've booked a doctor's appointment, ordered groceries, filed a government form, joined a book club, or returned an Amazon package, you already know how to write a test case.

## What we're looking for

| Contribution | Effort | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Add one new test case | ~30 min | Every additional site expands coverage |
| Add a batch of test cases in one new category (e.g., healthcare, K-12, real estate) | ~2-3 hours | Unlocks a new evaluation axis |
| Add a new model config (in `models/models.yaml`) | ~1 hour | Get your model on the leaderboard |
| Fix a flaky task (find a broken task, propose a fix) | ~20 min | Keeps the leaderboard fair |
| Translate docs into a new language | ~1 hour | Chinese / Japanese / Korean / Spanish welcomed |
| Report a bug via [issue template](https://github.com/reacher-z/ClawBench/issues/new/choose) | ~5 min | Helps us prioritize |

## Recognition for contributors

- **Every merged PR** — your GitHub avatar appears on the repo contributor wall automatically.
- **3+ merged test cases** — you're listed in the Community Contributors section of the README and thanked in the next arXiv paper revision's acknowledgments (with your consent).
- **A whole new category (10+ tasks)** — proposed as a co-author on the relevant follow-up paper / workshop submission.
- **Model runner** — your model ships on the live leaderboard at [claw-bench.com](https://claw-bench.com) with a direct link to your org.

## Good first issues

The issue tracker has a [`good first issue`](https://github.com/reacher-z/ClawBench/labels/good%20first%20issue) label for contributions sized at "30 minutes, no container experience required." Typical entries:

- Add a new test case for a site we don't yet cover (list in the issue description)
- Verify a flagged-flaky task still works
- Add an `extra_info/` file to enrich an existing task

If no `good first issue` is currently open, just open one with your idea and we'll label it and help you land the PR.

## Adding a new test case

ClawBench currently has two full task corpora: V1 lives in `test-cases/v1/` with 153 tasks, and V2 lives in `test-cases/v2/` with 130 tasks. Both use `test-cases/task.schema.json`. Unless a maintainer asks for a V2-only contribution, add new tasks to V1.

1. **Pick a task ID** — find the next available number by checking existing directories in the target corpus (`test-cases/v1/` for V1, or `test-cases/v2/` for V2).

2. **Create the directory** following the naming convention:
   ```
   test-cases/v1/<id>-<metaclass>-<class>-<platform>/
   ```
   Example: `test-cases/v1/887-daily-life-food-grubhub/`

   V2 directories use the `v2-` prefix:
   ```
   test-cases/v2/v2-<id>-<metaclass>-<class>-<platform>/
   ```

3. **Create `task.json`** in the directory. It must conform to `test-cases/task.schema.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "../../task.schema.json",
     "metadata": {
       "task_id": 887,
       "metaclass": "daily-life",
       "class": "food",
       "description": "Order a burger on Grubhub",
       "sites_involved": ["grubhub.com"],
       "platform": "grubhub",
       "common_info": {
         "email_credentials": "credentials to use the assigned disposable email account",
         "user_info": "alex_green_personal_info.json; the dummy user's personal information",
         "user_resume": "PDF resume with disposable email account injected"
       }
     },
     "instruction": "On Grubhub, order delivery: one cheeseburger to home address",
     "eval_schema": {
       "url_pattern": "__PLACEHOLDER_WILL_NOT_MATCH__",
       "method": "POST"
     },
     "time_limit": 30
   }
   ```
   For V2 tasks, use the same shared schema reference: `"$schema": "../../task.schema.json"`.

4. **Set the eval_schema** — this tells the interceptor which HTTP request to block:
   - If the task has an irreversible action (form submit, email send, application submit): set `url_pattern` to a regex matching the submission endpoint, and `method` to the HTTP method.
   - If the task is behind a payment wall (agent has no valid credit card): use `"url_pattern": "__PLACEHOLDER_WILL_NOT_MATCH__"` — the interceptor will never fire and the session runs until timeout.
   - See [`test-cases/task.schema.json`](test-cases/task.schema.json) for the supported `body` and `params` filters.

5. **Test with human mode** to verify the task is completable:
   ```bash
   uv run clawbench-run test-cases/v1/887-daily-life-food-grubhub --human
   ```
   For V2:
   ```bash
   uv run clawbench-run test-cases/v2/v2-887-daily-life-food-grubhub --human
   ```

6. **Submit a PR** with your new test case directory. Include in the PR description:
   - Which site and category
   - The URL where the "Submit" action fires (so reviewers can confirm the interceptor config)
   - A one-line note on whether the task is solvable by a human in under a minute

## Extra info files

If the task requires additional context (e.g., a pre-filled profile, a specific document), add files under `extra_info/` in the test case directory and reference them in `task.json`:

```json
"extra_info": [
  {
    "path": "extra_info/cover_letter.txt",
    "description": "Cover letter to attach with the application"
  }
]
```

## Code changes

For changes to the framework itself (test driver, extension server, Chrome extension, container):

1. Read the relevant sub-README for component-specific documentation:
   - [README.md#-cli](README.md#-cli)
   - [src/clawbench/runtime/extension-server/README.md](src/clawbench/runtime/extension-server/README.md)
   - [src/clawbench/runtime/chrome-extension/README.md](src/clawbench/runtime/chrome-extension/README.md)
2. Open an issue first for anything beyond a small bug fix so we can align on approach before you spend time.
3. Open a PR with a clear description of the change and how you tested it.
